All the changes should be performed in M_PEGDlg.h and M_PEGDlg.cpp

M_PEGDlg.cpp is used to write the calculation method

All results are stored in files named as dump_num.txt. The exact meaning of each file can be found in file M_PEGDlg.cpp
In order to increase the calculation time, unused calculation can be taken out by using /* */ at each section.
